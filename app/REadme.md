Sure! Based on the description you've provided, I can help you outline a high-level blueprint and flowchart for your Notes app. The app will utilize Jetpack Compose for UI, MVVM for architecture, Firebase for cloud storage, and Room for offline persistence.

### High-Level Blueprint of the Notes App:

1. **MVVM Architecture**:
    - **Model**: Represents the data layer, interacting with Firebase and Room DB.
    - **ViewModel**: Holds the logic and state for the UI, communicates with the Model.
    - **View**: The UI built using Jetpack Compose, which observes the ViewModel for changes.

2. **Firebase Integration**:
    - Firebase Firestore for storing and syncing user notes.
    - Firebase Authentication for user login (Google-based, user key-based Gmail ID).

3. **Room DB**:
    - For offline data storage. When the device is offline, the app will read/write from Room.
    - When the device comes online, the app syncs the data with Firebase.

4. **Offline-first design**:
    - Local Room DB is the first source of truth.
    - When internet is available, sync data with Firebase Firestore.

5. **Features**:
    - Create, edit, delete, and view notes.
    - Sync notes with Firebase when internet is available.
    - Store notes locally in Room for offline use.
    - Add images to notes and upload them to Firebase Storage.
    - Delete notes both locally and in Firebase.

### 1. **Architecture Breakdown:**

#### **Model Layer:**
- **Room Database**: This will hold the notes data locally.
    - **Note Entity**: Represents a single note.
    - **Note DAO**: Data access object for CRUD operations.

- **Firebase Integration**:
    - Firebase Firestore for storing notes in the cloud.
    - Firebase Authentication for managing user sessions.

- **Sync Logic**: The app should have a sync mechanism that checks internet connectivity and uploads or downloads data accordingly.

#### **ViewModel Layer**:
- The `LoginViewModel` handles the login, checking Firebase authentication state.
- The `NotesViewModel` handles the logic for displaying notes, adding, updating, deleting, and syncing with the database.

#### **View Layer**:
- Jetpack Compose will be used to create the UI.
    - Screens:
        - **LoginScreen**: For Google login.
        - **NotesListScreen**: Displays a list of notes (with offline support).
        - **AddEditNoteScreen**: Allows the user to add or edit a note.
        - **ImagePickerScreen**: For adding images to notes.

### 2. **Flowchart**

Here’s the flowchart to illustrate the app's major processes:

### 3. **Explanation of Flowchart**:

1. **User Launches App**: The user opens the app, and the first thing that happens is checking if the user is logged in or not.

2. **Authentication Check**:
    - **If the user is not logged in**, the app will show the `LoginScreen`, where the user can sign in using Google authentication (via Firebase Auth).
    - **If the user is logged in**, the app will directly show the `NotesListScreen`, which displays the user’s notes.

3. **Fetching Notes**:
    - The app will first check if the device is online. If the internet is available, it will sync the notes with Firebase Firestore.
    - If the device is offline, the app will fetch the notes from the **local Room database** and display them.

4. **Add/Edit Note**: The user can add or edit notes, which are stored in both **Room** (offline) and **Firebase** (online). When the device goes online, new/edited notes are synced with Firebase.

5. **Add Image**: For each note, the user can add an image. This image is uploaded to **Firebase Storage**, and the URL is stored in the Firebase Firestore document.

6. **Delete Note**: The user can delete a note, and the app will handle:
    - Removing it from both **Room** and **Firebase**.
    - The app will sync the deletions with Firebase when online.

---

### 4. **Room Database Schema**

Here’s a basic idea of how the Room database schema might look for your notes:

#### **Note Entity** (Room DB)

```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "notes")
data class Note(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0,
    val title: String,
    val content: String,
    val imageUrl: String? = null, // Optional field for image URL
    val createdAt: Long = System.currentTimeMillis(),
    val updatedAt: Long = System.currentTimeMillis()
)
```

#### **Note DAO** (Room DB)

```kotlin
@Dao
interface NoteDao {
    @Insert
    suspend fun insert(note: Note)

    @Update
    suspend fun update(note: Note)

    @Delete
    suspend fun delete(note: Note)

    @Query("SELECT * FROM notes")
    suspend fun getAllNotes(): List<Note>

    @Query("SELECT * FROM notes WHERE id = :id LIMIT 1")
    suspend fun getNoteById(id: Int): Note?
}
```

---

### 5. **Firebase Integration**:

#### **Firebase Firestore Structure**:

- **Collection**: `notes`
    - Each document will represent a single note with fields like `title`, `content`, `imageUrl`, `createdAt`, etc.

#### **Firebase Authentication**:

- **Sign-in with Google**: Use Firebase Auth to handle Google-based authentication.
- **User Key-Based Gmail ID**: Firebase Auth will allow you to associate the signed-in user with their Gmail ID.

#### **Firebase Storage**:

- **Image Upload**: When the user adds an image, it is uploaded to Firebase Storage, and the URL is saved in the Firestore document of the corresponding note.

### 6. **App Features**:

1. **Sign in with Google (Firebase Auth)**.
2. **Add, Edit, View, Delete Notes** (Firebase Firestore & Room).
3. **Add Images to Notes** (Firebase Storage).
4. **Offline Support** (Room DB stores data locally, syncs with Firestore when online).
5. **Sync Notes** (Sync notes with Firebase when internet is available).

---

### 7. **Sync Logic**:
- **Room DB** will be the local source of truth for offline use.
- **Firebase Firestore** will be used as the online source of truth, syncing data whenever the device is online.

The sync logic needs to handle:
- **One-way sync**: Sync data from local Room DB to Firebase when online.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle cases where a note is added/updated locally and remotely, ensuring data consistency.

---

### Conclusion

This blueprint and flowchart cover the high-level architecture of your Notes app. The key aspects are:
- **MVVM architecture** for clean separation of concerns.
- **Firebase** for authentication and cloud storage.
- **Room DB** for offline persistence.
- **Sync mechanism** to keep data consistent between the local Room database and Firebase when online.

You can now break down this blueprint into smaller tasks to implement each feature, starting with the user authentication, followed by CRUD operations for notes, then adding offline support and sync logic.
